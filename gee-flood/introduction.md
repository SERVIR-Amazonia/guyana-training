# Introduction

Welcome to Flood Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop contains multiple Google Earth Engine case studies. We will cover the use of spectral indices for surface water mapping, and a flooded land cover classification workflow. 

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the Guyana GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS)

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for filtering image collections, creating composites and indices, and training a classification model using collected data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
