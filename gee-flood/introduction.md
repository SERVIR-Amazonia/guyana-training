# Introduction

Welcome to Flood Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop contains multiple Google Earth Engine case studies. We will cover the use of spectral indices for surface water mapping, and a flooded land cover classification workflow. 

## Pre-workshop Set-up

### **[Detailed instructions on pre-workshop setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16N5wXbWi767AG4k-BPusu9Gc0HXKrY9qACFN9JZkiAA/edit?usp=sharing)**    

1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the Guyana GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS)
3. Enable access to [Planet NICFI](https://developers.planet.com/docs/integrations/gee/nicfi/#:~:text=To%20access%20the%20NICFI%20Basemaps%20in%20GEE%3A%201,enter%20the%20email%20associated%20with%20your%20GEE%20account.) data in GEE.

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for filtering image collections, creating composites and indices, and training a classification model using collected data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
