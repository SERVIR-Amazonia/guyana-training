# Challenges

Once you have completed ‘Mapping Flooded Areas using SAR’, keep that script open and review the following challenges. Work on whichever challenges are interesting to you. Collaborate with your colleagues and your instructors. Happy Coding!

## Sample Data

Spend a little more time collecting more reference polygons and refining existing ones - can you boost our class-specific accuracies?

## Map Strata/Classes

Refine the map stratification - can you come up with other map classes that would be useful instead of the one provided?

## Apply Trained CLassifier to Other SAR Data

Using your trained classifier, classify several SAR observations in succession for a short time period in an area you are familiar with. See if you can visualize a pattern in open water or flooded vegetation.

*Tip*: Remember `.map()`? This would be a great use for it. The last block of code could easily be converted into a function with which to map over another Sentinel1 SAR collection.
