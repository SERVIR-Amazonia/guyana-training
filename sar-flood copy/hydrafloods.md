## Bonus: Review of HYDRAfloods

The HYDrologic Remote Sensing Analysis for Floods platform or HYDRAFloods is a publicly available, web-based, near real-time tool for enhanced flood monitoring. https://hydrafloods-servir.adpc.net/ HYDRAFloods helps with emergency response and relief sectors by providing flood extent information. This flood monitoring system uses open-source satellite remote sensing data from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In addition, it was developed in Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud Platform with Python API.

Letâ€™s explore the different menus, such as materials, methodology & documentation, and use cases.
