The University of Guyana is Guyana's national higher education institution. It was established in April 1963 and began its operations in October of the same year. The mission of the University of Guyana is "to discover, generate, disseminate, and apply knowledge of the highest standard for the service of the community, the nation, and of all mankind within an atmosphere of academic freedom that allows for free and critical inquiry". The partnership between SERVIR-Amazonia and the University of Guyana (UG) is possible thorugh UG's Faculty of Earth & Environmental Sciences (FEES). This academic unit of the University of Guyana currently consists of two departments that are clustered in Environmental Studies and Geography in recognition of a growing need to produce Earth and Environmental Scientists with the requisite skills and knowledge to understand and appreciate the complexities of natural and human systems and their interactions, and the importance of applying sustainability principles to decision making processes that are informed by high quality research.
