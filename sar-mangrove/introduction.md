# Introduction

Welcome to SAR for Mangrove Monitoring workshop! This workshop will demonstrate a Random Forest classification mapping workflow using SAR data from the Sentinel-1 C band satellite. We will cover a few concepts of remote sensing for mangroves monitoring and implement a mangrove detection approach using Google Earth Engine.

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the trinidad-tobago GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/trinidad-tobago](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/trinidad-tobago)
3. Create a new script file in your own script repository - name it 'Mangroves Classification - Landsat'. Keep in mind a master copy is available in the above script repository.

## Objectives
1. Understand the general concepts of mangrove ecosystems
2. Learn how to develop a general process for training and applying land cover classification in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
