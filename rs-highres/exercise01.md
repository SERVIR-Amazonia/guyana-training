## Exercise 1: Working with QGIS : Planet Explorer plugin
In this exercise we will make use of the existent connection available between QGIS software and Planet catalog. We will explore the potential of high resolution products over traditional data. Let’s create a new folder for today's training and save the new project as ‘planet’.

In the Coordinate field, let’s type the word ‘World’ and press enter.
